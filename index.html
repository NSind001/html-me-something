                <h2>Albert Bender, Proto-Nerd</h2>

                <p>Albert Bender is at least partially the reason why the <b>Men in Black</b> have presented themselves on Earth. 
                <br><br>
                Born and raised in the United States, he was employed as a clock master at a local scissor factory.  In the 1940's Albert along with several of his friends created the ISFB to monitor, discuss, and bring awareness to UFO sightings that recently began across the globe.
                <br><br>
                All was well with the ISFB, which regularly produced newsletters to its growing membership base.</p>
                <br>
                <details>But that would not remain the case...</details>

                <h2>The First Encounter</h2>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p id="story">
                    One particular evening, after a successfully massively coordinated chaos magic ritual, Albert arrived at the home he shared with his step-father.  As he arrived in the attic room he built for himself, the walls adorned with several clocks all set to chime in unison every 15 minutes and paintings depicting UFOs &amp; horrifying things, he first smelled a very strong odor of sulfur. A faint yellow cloud appeared and two &quot;Men&quot; entered his bedroom door.<br><br>
                    The conversation lasted shortly before Albert was either teleported or induced into a lucid dream state wherein he appeared inside a remote base located in the Arctic.<br><br>
                    The &quot;Men,&quot; in standard 1940's style wore black suits with white shirts. They spoke and behaved strangely...as if they were an entity trying to be human. Their skin was a ghostly white, stretching across very long, thin fingers.  Fingers they didn't know how to use; fingers that didn't have joints but bent regardless. Their mouths - or more aptly put, face holes - were thinly outlined with red lipstick. Perhaps an attempt to create lips?

                <p class="scary">
                    The most disturbing, noted Albert, was their tendency to tap the lips with the back of their &quot;fingers&quot; , smearing the harsh red lipstick across their face-hole, exposing the lack of lips.
